# WinUI 3 + Windows System Restore Tool Development Practice and Reflections on the Microsoft Platform

## Technical Challenges and Details

When developing WinUI 3 desktop applications, we encountered several pain points. First, XAML controls have many new rules. For example, **ContentDialog** must have its XamlRoot manually set to display[\[1\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/zh-tw/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.contentdialog?view=windows-app-sdk-1.6#:~:text=%E7%95%B6%E6%82%A8%E9%A1%AF%E7%A4%BA%20ContentDialog%20%E6%99%82%EF%BC%8C%E6%82%A8%E5%BF%85%E9%A0%88%E6%89%8B%E5%8B%95%E5%B0%87%E5%B0%8D%E8%A9%B1%E6%A1%86%E7%9A%84%20XamlRoot%20%E8%A8%AD%E5%AE%9A%E7%82%BA,XamlRoot%20%E5%B1%AC%E6%80%A7%E8%A8%AD%E5%AE%9A%E7%82%BA%E8%88%87%E5%B7%B2%E5%9C%A8%20XAML%20%E6%A8%B9%E7%8B%80%E7%B5%90%E6%A7%8B%E4%B8%AD%E7%9A%84%E5%85%83%E7%B4%A0%E7%9B%B8%E5%90%8C%E7%9A%84%20XamlRoot%E3%80%82), otherwise it throws an error message (e.g., "_This element is already associated with a XamlRoot_")[\[2\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74370791/c-sharp-winui-3-desktop-application-issue-with-contentdialog-and-the-xamlroot#:~:text=Exception%20thrown%20at%200x00007FFFD5FE3FA9%20%28KernelBase,removed%20from%20the%20previous%20XamlRoot). Not noticing this initially can prevent the dialog from popping up.

Regarding the system restore functionality itself, Windows provides Win32 APIs like **SRSetRestorePoint**, and corresponding WMI classes[\[3\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/zh-tw/windows/win32/sr/system-restore-api#:~:text=%E6%9C%AC%E6%96%87%E5%85%A7%E5%AE%B9). However, system restore points have time limits (new points are retained for a maximum of 60 days)[\[3\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/zh-tw/windows/win32/sr/system-restore-api#:~:text=%E6%9C%AC%E6%96%87%E5%85%A7%E5%AE%B9), and creating them requires **administrator privileges** to succeed[\[4\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71699499/srsetrestorepoint-does-not-create-a-restore-point#:~:text=To%20create%20a%20restore%20point%2C,you%20must%20have%20administrator%20rights). This means the application must obtain elevated permissions before creating a system restore point. For instance, StackOverflow points out that "To create a restore point, you must have administrator rights"[\[4\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71699499/srsetrestorepoint-does-not-create-a-restore-point#:~:text=To%20create%20a%20restore%20point%2C,you%20must%20have%20administrator%20rights). Furthermore, when packaged as an MSIX or UWP app, direct calls to WMI or COM classes are often denied due to Windows app sandbox restrictions. Mechanisms like runFullTrust (using Desktop Bridge or external processes) are needed to achieve this[\[5\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/packaging/app-capability-declarations#:~:text=But%20there%20are%20some%20scenarios,support%20for%20the%20Desktop%20Bridge)[\[6\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72105566/do-winui-applications-need-runfulltrust-to-publish-to-the-windows-store#:~:text=,publish%20to%20the%20Windows%20Store).

**Multilingual support** in WinUI 3 is also not straightforward. Separate .resw files are required for each language (placed in Strings\\xx-XX folders) and referenced using x:Uid or ms-resource. After modifying resources, the .pri index must be regenerated using **MakePri.exe**, otherwise the new strings won't take effect. Microsoft documentation recommends using a post-build script to automatically run MakePri and copy the output resources.pri to the output directory[\[7\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/mrtcore/localize-strings#:~:text=recommend%20using%20a%20post,exe%20directory). Regrettably, WinUI 3 currently only supports applying the system language at application startup; it cannot hot-swap languages like mobile frameworks can. As mentioned in the community on V2EX: "According to the official documentation, you first need to store the strings in resw files, then reference them in XAML using x:Uid, and the program can automatically recognize them based on the system locale." Implementing dynamic language switching requires workarounds like using ApplicationLanguages.PrimaryLanguageOverride combined with reloading pages, or manually updating UI strings one by one using ResourceLoader. Such compromise solutions are cumbersome and often pitfalls for developers.

Packaging and permissions are another major challenge. WinUI 3 desktop applications default to the **Full-Trust** model, so Package.appxmanifest typically includes &lt;rescap:Capability Name="runFullTrust"/&gt;[\[6\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72105566/do-winui-applications-need-runfulltrust-to-publish-to-the-windows-store#:~:text=,publish%20to%20the%20Windows%20Store). This means when publishing to the Microsoft Store, the system considers it a restricted capability and requires justification[\[6\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72105566/do-winui-applications-need-runfulltrust-to-publish-to-the-windows-store#:~:text=,publish%20to%20the%20Windows%20Store). In fact, Microsoft officially states that "WinUI 3 apps use the full-trust desktop model. If the package manifest includes the restricted runFullTrust capability, you must answer additional questions when submitting"[\[6\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72105566/do-winui-applications-need-runfulltrust-to-publish-to-the-windows-store#:~:text=,publish%20to%20the%20Windows%20Store). If strange resource errors occur during packaging, there are official countermeasures. For example, compilation might sometimes fail with MSB4018 or PRI resource generation errors. Microsoft documentation suggests disabling automatic PRI generation in the project properties:

&lt;AppxGeneratePrisForPortableLibrariesEnabled&gt;false&lt;/AppxGeneratePrisForPortableLibrariesEnabled&gt;

This can avoid the MSB4018 "GenerateResource task failed" error[\[9\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/desktop/desktop-to-uwp-known-issues#:~:text=This%20can%20happen%20when%20trying,PRI%29%20files). Additionally, during our testing, we encountered inexplicable resources.pri copy errors (DirectoryNotFoundException), which ultimately required a complete project rebuild to resolve[\[10\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72066002/winui3-build-started-failing-randomly-giving-a-odd-error-about-resources-pri#:~:text=Judging%20from%20the%20error%2C%20the,correctly%20when%20it%20was%20run).

In summary, MSIX packaging often has various pitfalls, including signing, certificates, and permissions, which need to be troubleshooted one by one.

## Observations and Reflections on the Microsoft Platform

Looking at the state of WinUI 3 and Windows App SDK from this project, while it brings a modern UI framework, the overall development experience still needs improvement. Community comments on WinUI 3 frequently mention: **Poor development experience** (currently no intuitive designer, reliance on writing XAML, slow compilation speed), **Large installation package size** (an empty WinUI 3 C# app is over 40MB[\[11\]](https://github.com/Scighost/WinUI3Keng#:~:text=,5%5D%E3%80%82)), **Poor interop performance** (due to high CsWinRT call overhead)[\[11\]](https://github.com/Scighost/WinUI3Keng#:~:text=,5%5D%E3%80%82), and **Immature third-party ecosystem** (officially released for less than a year, few available controls)[\[11\]](https://github.com/Scighost/WinUI3Keng#:~:text=,5%5D%E3%80%82). These shortcomings make WinUI 3 feel not yet ready for production tools. Many developers complain that the desktop development experience pales in comparison to mobile frameworks' hot reload and live preview; making changes in WinUI 3 requires restarting the application, making it feel "rigid and awkward"[\[12\]](https://cn.v2ex.com/t/1116798#:~:text=%E6%9C%80%E5%90%8E%E6%88%91%E6%83%B3%E5%90%90%E6%A7%BD%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%8B%EF%BC%8C%E6%80%AA%E4%B8%8D%E5%BE%97%E7%8E%B0%E5%9C%A8%E8%AF%B4%E6%A1%8C%E9%9D%A2%E5%AE%A2%E6%88%B7%E7%AB%AF%E6%B2%A1%E4%BA%BA%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E4%BA%86%EF%BC%8C%E6%84%9F%E8%A7%89%E5%85%89%E4%BB%8E%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E5%B7%A5%E5%85%B7%E7%9A%84%E4%BE%BF%E5%88%A9%E6%80%A7%E4%B8%8A%E5%B0%B1%E8%A2%AB%E7%A7%BB%E5%8A%A8%E7%AB%AF%E5%AE%8C%E7%88%86%E4%BA%86%E3%80%82%E7%8E%B0%E5%9C%A8%E7%A7%BB%E5%8A%A8%E7%AB%AF%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E5%90%84%E7%A7%8D%E7%83%AD%E9%87%8D%E8%BD%BD%E8%BE%B9%E6%94%B9%E8%BE%B9%E7%9C%8B%EF%BC%8C%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E4%BD%93%E9%AA%8C%E4%B8%9D%E8%88%AC%E6%B6%A6%E6%BB%91%EF%BC%8C%E7%82%B9%E5%90%8D%E8%A1%A8%E6%89%AC%20flutter%20%E3%80%82%E6%A1%8C%E9%9D%A2%E7%AB%AF%20winui3%20%E7%A8%8D%E5%BE%AE%E6%94%B9%E7%82%B9%E4%B8%9C%E8%A5%BF%E7%A8%8B%E5%BA%8F%E5%B0%B1%E8%A6%81%E5%AE%8C%E5%85%A8%E9%87%8D%E5%90%AF%EF%BC%8C%E5%90%AF%E5%8A%A8%E9%80%9F%E5%BA%A6%E8%BF%98%E8%B4%9C%E6%85%A2%EF%BC%8C%E8%AF%B4%E6%98%AF%E5%8E%9F%E7%94%9F%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E4%BD%86%E6%98%AF%E5%90%84%E7%A7%8D%E5%8A%9F%E8%83%BD%E5%AE%9E%E7%8E%B0%E4%B9%9F%E4%B8%8D%E8%88%92%E6%9C%8D%EF%BC%8C%E6%80%BB%E4%B9%8B%E5%B0%B1%E6%98%AF%E7%BB%99%E4%BA%BA%E4%B8%80%E7%A7%8D%E7%A1%AC%E9%82%A6%E9%82%A6%E7%9A%84%E6%84%9F%E8%A7%89%E3%80%82%E5%B0%B1%E8%BF%99%E7%A7%8D%E4%BD%93%E9%AA%8C%EF%BC%8C%E8%83%BD%E6%AF%94%E4%BA%BA%E5%AE%B6%E5%A5%BD%E6%89%8D%E6%80%AA%E4%BA%86%E3%80%82). Moreover, Microsoft only recently announced "truly open-sourcing" the WinUI 3 source code, but progress is slow[\[13\]](https://eu.36kr.com/en/p/3411202919747200#:~:text=Actually%2C%20the%20title%20of%20the,repo). Many have joked, "Even Microsoft itself doesn't use it, so why should we?"[\[14\]](https://eu.36kr.com/en/p/3411202919747200#:~:text=However%2C%20recently%2C%20many%20developers%20have,the%20community%20to%20use%20it).

Observations on the Microsoft Store and app sandbox policy: The Store is very strict in reviewing runFullTrust, requiring justification for why this permission is needed upon submission[\[6\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72105566/do-winui-applications-need-runfulltrust-to-publish-to-the-windows-store#:~:text=,publish%20to%20the%20Windows%20Store). Even though WinUI 3 isn't UWP, packaging as APPX inherently includes full-trust capabilities. This forces developers to compromise. Experienced developers complain: "There's no way to remove this setting; when publishing, you can only explain to the reviewer 'This is the official msix packaging mechanism'"[\[15\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77764786/remove-runfulltrust-capability-from-flutter-windows-application#:~:text=I%27ve%20just%20published%20my%20flutter,following%20explanation%20to%20the%20reviewer). For raw WMI or COM interfaces, they can only be used indirectly by introducing Out-Of-Process COM or PowerShell via runFullTrust (essentially asking the system to do the work), significantly increasing complexity.

Furthermore, the desktop application landscape now has multiple coexisting technologies: WinForms, WPF, UWP, WinUI, Console apps, etc., lacking a single, unified direction. As foreign media评论: "Every few years [Microsoft] launches new technology, many eventually abandoned; names and roadmaps change frequently, making it confusing"[\[16\]](https://eu.36kr.com/en/p/3411202919747200#:~:text=Every%20few%20years%2C%20Microsoft%20launches,is%20just%20one%20factor). This fragmentation creates more confusion about the future roadmap and adds to the cost of choice for developers.

## Comprehensive View and Community Sentiment

Overall, this project allowed us to experience some advantages of WinUI 3 (modern style, Fluent controls, etc.) but also exposed numerous inconsistencies. While enduring various configuration, permission, and slow compilation issues, it's hard not to develop a sense of distrust towards Microsoft's technology strategy. Many developers调侃 that to implement a UI for a system restore function, one must "summon COM, PowerShell, manifest just to execute," feeling like summoning a mythical beast. Common complaints in the community include "WinUI 3 stability is insufficient," "official documentation is outdated and vague," etc. For example, some say, "On desktop, WinUI 3 requires a complete app restart for minor changes, startup is surprisingly slow, the experience feels rigid and awkward"[\[12\]](https://cn.v2ex.com/t/1116798#:~:text=%E6%9C%80%E5%90%8E%E6%88%91%E6%83%B3%E5%90%90%E6%A7%BD%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%8B%EF%BC%8C%E6%80%AA%E4%B8%8D%E5%BE%97%E7%8E%B0%E5%9C%A8%E8%AF%B4%E6%A1%8C%E9%9D%A2%E5%AE%A2%E6%88%B7%E7%AB%AF%E6%B2%A1%E4%BA%BA%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E4%BA%86%EF%BC%8C%E6%84%9F%E8%A7%89%E5%85%89%E4%BB%8E%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E5%B7%A5%E5%85%B7%E7%9A%84%E4%BE%BF%E5%88%A9%E6%80%A7%E4%B8%8A%E5%B0%B1%E8%A2%AB%E7%A7%BB%E5%8A%A8%E7%AB%AF%E5%AE%8C%E7%88%86%E4%BA%86%E3%80%82%E7%8E%B0%E5%9C%A8%E7%A7%BB%E5%8A%A8%E7%AB%AF%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E5%90%84%E7%A7%8D%E7%83%AD%E9%87%8D%E8%BD%BD%E8%BE%B9%E6%94%B9%E8%BE%B9%E7%9C%8B%EF%BC%8C%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E4%BD%93%E9%AA%8C%E4%B8%9D%E8%88%AC%E6%B6%A6%E6%BB%91%EF%BC%8C%E7%82%B9%E5%90%8D%E8%A1%A8%E6%89%AC%20flutter%20%E3%80%82%E6%A1%8C%E9%9D%A2%E7%AB%AF%20winui3%20%E7%A8%8D%E5%BE%AE%E6%94%B9%E7%82%B9%E4%B8%9C%E8%A5%BF%E7%A8%8B%E5%BA%8F%E5%B0%B1%E8%A6%81%E5%AE%8C%E5%85%A8%E9%87%8D%E5%90%AF%EF%BC%8C%E5%90%AF%E5%8A%A8%E9%80%9F%E5%BA%A6%E8%BF%98%E8%B4%9C%E6%85%A2%EF%BC%8C%E8%AF%B4%E6%98%AF%E5%8E%9F%E7%94%9F%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E4%BD%86%E6%98%AF%E5%90%84%E7%A7%8D%E5%8A%9F%E8%83%BD%E5%AE%9E%E7%8E%B0%E4%B9%9F%E4%B8%8D%E8%88%92%E6%9C%8D%EF%BC%8C%E6%80%BB%E4%B9%8B%E5%B0%B1%E6%98%AF%E7%BB%99%E4%BA%BA%E4%B8%80%E7%A7%8D%E7%A1%AC%E9%82%A6%E9%82%A6%E7%9A%84%E6%84%9F%E8%A7%89%E3%80%82%E5%B0%B1%E8%BF%99%E7%A7%8D%E4%BD%93%E9%AA%8C%EF%BC%8C%E8%83%BD%E6%AF%94%E4%BA%BA%E5%AE%B6%E5%A5%BD%E6%89%8D%E6%80%AA%E4%BA%86%E3%80%82). It's even observed that WinUI 3 is currently not Microsoft's internal preferred technology: "Even Microsoft itself doesn't use it, yet asks the community to use it?"[\[14\]](https://eu.36kr.com/en/p/3411202919747200#:~:text=However%2C%20recently%2C%20many%20developers%20have,the%20community%20to%20use%20it). Facing this, developers often形容 half-jokingly and half-helplessly: "Sigh, these technologies are so complicated; in the end, you still have to find your own way to deliver the project."

**Summary:** The development experience with WinUI 3 and the system restore tool tells us that while it's possible to create modern application experiences, one must be prepared to face various SDK limitations and pitfalls. From core API permissions and sandbox restrictions to the recently revamped UI framework, the process involves constant adjustment and workarounds.
